                        <p class="timeline__content-desc">The Eucharistic Miracle of Lanciano, located in the region of
                            Abruzzo, is par excellence the most well-known in the Catholic Church.
                            The miracle took place in the eighth century in a church administered by Basilian monks.
                            Similar to Bolsena, one of the priests was doubting the Real Presence. As he pronounced the
                            consecration, the host was transformed into flesh, the wine into blood. The Body took on the
                            form of a heart, and the Blood coagulated into five irregularly-shaped globules.</p>

                            In 1330, a priest was preparing to visit a dying parishioner not far from Siena. He
                            carelessly placed a consecrated host in his prayer breviary rather than in a pyx. When he
                            arrived at the sick man's house, he heard his confession and granted him absolution. When he
                            opened the breviary, he discovered the host bleeding, both pages stained with blood. One of
                            the pages is conserved in Cascia.</p>

                            transubstantiation, experienced a miracle while celebrating Mass. The consecrated host began
                            to bleed onto the altar cloth, leaving visible stains. This miracle led Pope Urban IV to
                            institute the Feast of Corpus Christi. The bloodstained corporal is enshrined in the
                            Cathedral of Orvieto. Pilgrims continue to visit the site to venerate this profound sign of

                            Jorge Mario Bergoglio revealed the tissue was human cardiac tissue. Scientists noted that
                            the tissue showed signs of severe stress, consistent with a suffering heart. This
                            Eucharistic miracle deepened devotion to the Real Presence in the region. Today, it serves
                            as a profound testament to faith for Catholics in Argentina and around the world.</p>

                            witnessed by many and later approved by Church authorities. The Eucharistic miracle
                            reinforced the belief in Christ’s presence in the host. The event is commemorated annually

                            centuries. This miracle deepened devotion to the Eucharist in Poland. It has been recognized
                            as one of the country’s most significant Eucharistic events.</p>

                            his caretakers. The event became known as the "Miracle of the Host" and inspired devotion
                            throughout the Netherlands. Though the original host was destroyed during the Protestant
                            Reformation, the story continues to be celebrated in the Amsterdam procession. This miracle
                            is remembered as a testament to Christ’s enduring presence.</p>
