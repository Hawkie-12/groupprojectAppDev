                <h1>The Institution of the Eucharist (The Last Supper)</h1>
                <p>Jesus Christ instituted the Eucharist during the Last Supper with His apostles, as described in the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) and 1 Corinthians 11:23-26.
                   Jesus shared bread and wine, declaring them His Body and Blood, establishing the sacrament of the Eucharist as a perpetual remembrance of His sacrifice on the cross.
                   Key Words: "Do this in memory of me."</p>

                <h1 class="f3 text--accent ttu"> Early Church and Apostolic Traditions</h1>
                <p> The Eucharist became central to Christian worship in the early church, celebrated as a communal meal known as the "Breaking of the Bread." Writings by early Church Fathers like St. Ignatius of Antioch and St. Justin Martyr provided insight into its practice and belief in the Real Presence of Christ.
                The theology and liturgy of the Eucharist developed to reflect Christ’s presence, aligning it with the sacrifice of the cross.
                    Key Writings:
                    Didache (c. 90 AD)
                    St. Justin Martyr's First Apology (c. 155 AD)</p>

                <h1 class="f3 text--accent ttu">The Middle Ages and the Doctrine of Transubstantiation</h1>
                <p>Theological debates regarding the nature of the Eucharist culminated in the Fourth Lateran Council (1215), where the doctrine of Transubstantiation was formally defined. This teaching emphasized that the bread and wine truly become the Body and Blood of Christ, even though their appearance remains unchanged.
                   The Eucharist became central to Catholic doctrine, leading to the establishment of practices such as Eucharistic Adoration and the Feast of Corpus Christi (1264).

                <h1 class="f3 text--accent ttu">The Protestant Reformation and the Council of Trent</h1>
                <p>The Protestant Reformation (1517) challenged Catholic teachings on the Eucharist. Reformers like Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Ulrich Zwingli presented differing views:
                    Luther: Consubstantiation (Christ is present alongside the bread and wine).
                    Zwingli: Symbolic presence only.
                    Calvin: Spiritual presence.
                    In response, the Council of Trent (1545–1563) reaffirmed the Catholic belief in Transubstantiation and the Real Presence.
                    Significance: The Council clarified and defended the Eucharist as a sacrament instituted by Christ, strengthening its role in Catholic worship.</p>

                <img src="/image/1528bce.png" width="100%">
                <p>Passover was the event where the Israelite
                    people were passed into freedom from slavery.
                    It is considered the origin of Eucharist</p>

                <h2>The Last Supper</h2>
                <img src="image/33(1).png" width="100%">
                <p>During the Last Supper Jesus shared the bread
                    and wine around the table. Symbolizing his
                    sacrifice in the form of his blood and body.</p>

                <h2>Key Symbols</h2>
                <img src="image/33(2).png" width="100%">
                <p>The bread, or communion, symbolized Jesus' body
                    while the wine symbolized his blood.
                    Both represented both life and sacrifice</p>
                <br>
                <h2>New Passover</h2>
                <p>When Jesus handed over the bread and wine to his
                    disciples it was considered the New Passover.
                    Many of the actions he did were likened to the
                    actions of the First Passover.</p>

                <h2>'Breaking of the Bread'</h2>
                <img src="image/55.png" width="100%">
                <p>The first recorded use of communion in a church
                    was found in Paul's letter to the Corinthians.
                    He states that phrases such as 'do this as a
                    memorial of me' and 'this cup is the new covenant
                    in my blood' which are very similar to the words
                    spoken today during Eucharist</p>

            <div class="section-content" data-content="4">
                <h2>Early Eucharist</h2>
                <p>Christians would gather on the first day of the week,
                    Sunday, to celebrate together. They would break the
                    bread, quoting 'do this in memory of me' and believed
                    that they were eating and drinking the body and blood
                    of the Lord. It was also believed that Jesus was kept
                    alive through reading and telling stories.</p>

                <h2>Eucharist in the Middle Ages</h2>
                <img src="image/1200.png" width="100%">
                <p>Eucharist became more of a revered practice throughout
                    the Middle Ages. It became a custom that children
                    would not receive the communion until 12 or 14 years
                    old - something that still occurs today. Adults would
                    also not take the communion frequently, only at
                    important times.</p>

                <h2>Eucharistic Reform</h2>
                <img src="image/1500.png" width="100%">
                <p>During the 16th century Pope Pius V allowed a reform to
                    occur within the Roman Catholic Church. This created a
                    unified practice of the Eucharist and allowed all
                    teachings of it to be synthesized.</p>

                <h2>Inner Nature of Communion</h2>
                <img src="image/1900.png" width="100%">
                <p>To many the bread and wine may appear as just that.
                    Christians believe that once a priest consecrates the
                    bread and wine its inner nature does change and it
                    becomes the body and blood of Christ - despite its
                    outwards appearance not changing.</p>

                <p>Today the reception of Eucharist is broken into four
                    different parts: The Introductory Rites, The Liturgy
                    of the Word, The Liturgy of the Eucharist and The
                    Concluding Rites. Together these four parts make up
